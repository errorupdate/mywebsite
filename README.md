That's a great idea\! A README file helps you, and any future collaborators, quickly understand what the project is about, how to set it up, and how to contribute.

Since this is a personal website, the focus is more on documentation and setup rather than external contributions.

Here is a template you can customize for your personal website's `README.md` file.
